# springboot-2.1-boilerplate
This is an initial template for starting a project based on springboot 2.1.x. It exists because start.spring.io no longer supports creating projects from older versions such as 2.1.x.

But the reality is that many projects based on 2.1.x already exist, so when starting a new project, I want to build it based on the same version, so that subsequent development and maintenance is easier. Create a starter template for an outdated version of springboot.

This project template contains some basic components such as apache and google tool libraries, json serialization/deserialization components, etc., and jdbc references. But it does not contain MQ, redis, and other related components, so customize it to your needs in pom.xml.
